# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run dev          # Watch mode for development
npm start            # Run compiled code
npm test             # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint         # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting errors
npm run typecheck    # Type-check without emitting
```

To run a single test file:
```bash
npx vitest run src/index.test.ts
```

To run tests matching a pattern:
```bash
npx vitest run -t "greet"
```

## Architecture

- **src/**: TypeScript source files
- **dist/**: Compiled JavaScript output (generated by `npm run build`)
- Tests are co-located with source files using `.test.ts` suffix
- Uses ESM with NodeNext module resolution
